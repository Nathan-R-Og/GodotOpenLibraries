# GodotOpenLibraries
libraries that would be extremely useful starting out on godot





to use literally any of these / build upon them:
1. download
2. go into godot
3. go to a project/make a new one
4. import files
5. watch the magic




these are open so that they can be continously built upon by me and others so :)))
